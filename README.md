# Car-Gate-System ðŸš—
The Car-Gate-System is an Arduino Uno-based project designed to automate the opening and closing of a gate when a car is detected. The system uses an ultra-sonic sensor to detect the presence of a car and a servo motor to open the gate. An emergency button is also included to manually open the gate in case the sensor malfunctions.
